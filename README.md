# About Me
## Introduction
Hello Fellas, i'm Jonas Kauker and i'm coding since 2020 (started in 2018 with small projects but had no real progress).
## Backstory
Back when i was young i always loved to build things with whatever i could find. I used to experiment around with numerous things which some of them became a hobby of mine.  I started doing Photography, Videography, tried to create Music. When i started playing games like Minecraft, i wanted to create my own things for those games and so i got into coding.
