Hello Fellas, i'm Jonas Kauker, 20 years old and i'm coding since 2020. I'm a professional Sea of Thieves Player. I'm coding as a hobby and want to work as a developer in the future.
## Backstory
Back when i was young i always loved to build things with whatever i could find. I used to experiment around with numerous things which some of them became a hobby of mine.  I started doing Photography, Videography, tried to create Music. When i started playing games like Minecraft, i wanted to create my own things for those games and so i got into coding.
